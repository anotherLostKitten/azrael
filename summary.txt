2018-10-28

Summary Document:
The project works as expected. The user will have to register, and then log in
with the registered account. Afterwards, they will be able to add to existing
stories, create new stories, or view stories that they have contributed to. 

Johnny Wong worked on the database and the sqlite commands used to manipulate 
the database in the python file. Jason Tung tested, wrote python commands to 
use the templates that Sarar Aseer wrote with Jinja and HTML, and designed the
webpage using flask. Zane Wang served as project manager, resolving disputes, 
identifying bugs, testing the website, and uploading important documents.
